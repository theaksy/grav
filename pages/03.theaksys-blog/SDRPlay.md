# Trialling the SDRPlay RDPdx
I managed to borrow an [SDRPlay SDRdx[(https://www.sdrplay.com/rspdx/) which  has better [specs[(https://www.sdrplay.com/resources/RSPdxDatasheet.pdf) to the RTL SDR v4 and HackRF One. In particular I was interested in the larger 14-bit ADC that may help me with the NOAA reception so close to an FM transmitter.

# Software
After plugging in I couldnt see it in Satdump as a source, though the docs say it is supported. Therefore I downloaded [SDR Connect](https://www.sdrplay.com/sdrconnect/)

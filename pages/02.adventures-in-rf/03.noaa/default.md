#### âš¡ What Causes the Center Spike?
- **DC Offset in IQ Data:** Most SDRs (especially RTL-SDRs) introduce a small DC bias in the I/Q signal. When you perform an FFT, this bias shows up as a strong spike at 0 Hz (the center of the spectrum).

- **Imperfect IQ Balance:** RTL-SDRs donâ€™t have hardware IQ correction, so any imbalance between the I and Q channels leads to leakage at DC.

- **No Built-in DC Blocking in FFT Display:** SatDump doesnâ€™t remove the DC spike from the waterfall or FFT displayâ€”it only blocks it behind the scenes before demodulation if you enable the right setting.

#### ðŸ›  How to Deal With It in SatDump
- **Enable DC Blocking:** In the Configure tab for your satellite or in Offline Processing, look for a setting called DC Blocking. This wonâ€™t remove the spike from the FFT view, but it will prevent it from interfering with decoding.

- **Offset the Tuning Frequency:** Shift your center frequency slightly so the signal of interest isnâ€™t sitting right on top of the DC spike.

- **Use a Better SDR:** Devices like Airspy or SDRplay have better IQ balance and often donâ€™t suffer from this issue as severely.

#### ðŸ§ª Bonus Tip
If you're using a decimation factor, make sure your low-pass filter is properly configuredâ€”otherwise, aliasing can make the DC spike even more pronounced.
